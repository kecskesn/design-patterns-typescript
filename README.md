# Introduction

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems. They are best practices that evolved over a long period of time.

There are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories. This little repository contains examples for all of them, with real world examples, so you can get a grasp of how they work, and possibly, when to use them.

One thing to keep in mind though: do not try to force these into every situation. If they are used correctly they can help you out a ton, but if not, the result can be horrible.

## Types of Design Patterns

- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

# Setup Project

node .\dist\01-creational-patterns\01-simple-factory\main.js
```
