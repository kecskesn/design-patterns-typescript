## Introduction

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems. They are best practices that evolved over a long period of time.

Wikipedia describes them as

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

There are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories. This little repository contains examples for all of them, with real world examples, so can get a grasp of how they work, and possibly, when to use them.

One thing to keep in mind though: do not try to force these into every situation. If they are used correctly they can help you out a ton, but if not, the result can be horrible.

Types of Design Patterns
-----------------

* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral

## Setup Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kecskesn/design-patterns-typescript.git
cd design-patterns-typeScript
npm install -g typescript
npm install
npm start

# run each pattern separately, e.g,
node .\dist\01-creational-patterns\01-factory\client.js
```
