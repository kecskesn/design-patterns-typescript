# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them.

Wikipedia says

> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
