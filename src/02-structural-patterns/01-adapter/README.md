# Adapter

Real world example

> When you travel from the US to Europe for the first time, you may get a surprise when trying to charge your laptop. The power plug and sockets standards are different in different countries. That’s why your US plug won’t fit a German socket. The problem can be solved by using a power plug adapter that has the American-style socket and the European-style plug.

In plain words

> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

Wikipedia says

> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

When to use?

Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.
