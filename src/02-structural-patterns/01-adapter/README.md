# Adapter

## Real world example

> When you travel from the US to Europe for the first time, you may get a surprise when trying to charge your laptop. The power plug and sockets standards are different in different countries. That’s why your US plug won’t fit a German socket. The problem can be solved by using a power plug adapter that has the American-style socket and the European-style plug.

## In plain words

> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

## When to use??

Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.

The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class, a 3rd-party class or any other class with a weird interface.
